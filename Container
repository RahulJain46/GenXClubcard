1. Why container ? use case ?

Before 20s we were having servers - big servers,  for cooling also we need lots of money and resource . Space , 
how much would be the size of resource ? 
One app run on one server .



then ,

VMWare - they have hypervisor virtualisation technology , we have one server and multiple apps can run on it .

One server - multiple apps , divide in four server , have its own CPU, hard disk etc
