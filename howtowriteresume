ðŸ“Œ If you have worked in more than one company, make sure you showcase career growth [maybe when you started your career, you were only writing codes but now you are designing the architecture too]

ðŸ“Œ There should be upgrade in your current skills from your past experience [maybe you picked up big data skills recently]

ðŸ“Œ Showcase your Leadership/Mentoring skills [even if you mentor new joinees, please mention it]

ðŸ“Œ Make it a data driven resume. Show how your contribution has contributed to the growth [maybe your work has resulted in increase of productivity by 5%]

ðŸ“Œ Show that you are still eager to learn. Mention if you have completed certification for any skills

ðŸ“Œ A huge plus if you write blogs or build any product on your personal time as that speaks a lot about your passion

ðŸ“Œ If you worked on a project with 20 team members, mention what exactly was your contribution as every company wants to know your contribution

ðŸ“Œ Always save your resume with your name and role title [Eg: Imran Recruiter Resume]

ðŸ“Œ Save your resume in PDF format, it gives a professional look & also avoids any formatting issues. Just click 'save as' and choose file type - save in pdf

ðŸ“Œ A one pager is best, if needed create your resume in A3 sheet [open Microsoft office, select layout option and change size from the drop down]. This will give you ample size
