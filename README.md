Hi,

•	I am a software programmer, with 6.4 years of experience working in GE oil and gas.  I have started my career with Tesco and their I spend around 3.8 years. 
•	Tesco has a customer loyalty reward program, for that project my core responsibility was to create responsive and scalable website. The legacy application was developed in .NET but after that we have migrated the application in React Js and Node Js. 
•	On the frontend we have used React Js and Apollo client. And the middleware between the backend and frontend we have used graphQl and node Js.
•	As part of development team , I have to do system design and gather the requirement from product owner, interact with UX team and QA .
•	I have used the tools like adobe omniture to monitor the website tracking , bazaar voice for product review and rating . 
•	APM for performance monitoring and splunk for aggregate and visualize the logs .
•	For many months I have supported the LIVE website via oncall using JIRA and Zendisk.
•	The application was newly build so I have fixed all the security related vulnerabilities while penetration testing.
•	From the starting I am using github , I have used bitbucket, SVN and TFS also .
•	I am quite comfortable following all the agile practices like daily standup , planning , grooming and retro.
This is the small summary of the experience in Tesco.
After that I have moved to GE and joined platform team.
•	The product AI factory is a framework of microservices which enables data scientists to run analytics model includes Machine learning models or physics based model . 
•	AI factory deploy and run the model at the larger scale and we can orchestrace the models also .
•	There is a web app where SMEs or data scientists can run , deploy and visualize the result. 
•	This is a single page application which has charts , grid and multiple metric tiles and developed using React Js , Plotly and Redux .
•	In the backend we have node Js and Python , my responsibility is to mentor the junior member of the team , do the code review , get involved in design discussions and work on UI as well as backend part . I have good experience with Docker and Kuberntes also .
I am quick leaner and love to explore new technology and challenges.
