Samsung : 
1. Merge k sorted linked-list
2. Search in rotated sorted array
3. Design LRU system  
4. write a program to create circular queue?  
5. Web Development: Difference between RESTful & SOAP (include security point)?  
6. Operating System: Interprocess Communication and its types.  
7. Database: What is Foreign keys? they will ask related case scenarios  
Design and Development of REST API.
Scaling large scale websites.
Complex MySql Queries etc.  
What are the differences between Java and C++. Describe Java's garbage collection. A bunch of questions about threads  
threading and memory management.
A search question which uses recursion 
Several rounds with various topics like coding, algorithms, logic, ML, statistics.  
Problem was to create an array from one input array where every element in output array is the next biggest element from that element.  

complexity of the program.
Given a graph, find out if it can be colored using 2 colors. Different colors for alternate nodes (3 hours) people who passed all 10 test cases were shortlisted.
Note- You can compile your code as many number of times as you want, but a maximum of 5 submissions were allowed to test on the given test cases.

10. OOPS-
Critical Section, Mutex , Semaphores, Paging, Techniques to swap out pages (Least recently used, least frequently used).
9. Asked to write my own typedef operator- I used function template to write a generic function.
8. Asked if I knew Dijkstra’s Algorithm, I said yes, asked if I could write the pseudo code- I wrote it fast, Asked to explain why Dijkstra’s algo fails when -ve weights are there in the graph.
6. A few codes on pointers, asked me the outputs.
e.g. const pointers and pointers to const.
4. Wrote a few codes on run-time polymorphism and asked me to write the outputs.
e.g. virtual destructor, inheritance with virtual keyword.
5. Asked me what pure virtual classes are?
